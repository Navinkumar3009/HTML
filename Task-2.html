        pages that tells a browser how to display certain elements, such as text and images
        through the use of codes and symbols.

        headings, which use the elements (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)</p>

        HTML document. You can do this by using the <b>html</b> tag.<br>

        document.<br>

        document.<br>
        The <b>body</b> is basically the content of your HTML document.
