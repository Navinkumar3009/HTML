    <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj: The Maratha Legend</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to be one of
        the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the
        folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining
        Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire..</p>
    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childhood & Early Life</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the fort of Shivneri, near the city
        of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji’s father Shahaji was in service of the Bijapuri Sultanate - a tripartite
        association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune.
        Shivaji’s mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader Lakhujirao Jadhav and a deeply religious woman.
        Shivaji was especially close to his mother who instilled in him a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji
        spent most of his time outside of Pune, the responsibility of overseeing Shivaji’s education rested on the
        shoulders of a small council of ministers which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna
        Pant), a Sabnis (Raghunath Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji Jedhe and
        Baji Pasalkar were appointed to train Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji was married to Saibai
        Nimbalkar in 1640.

    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggles with Bijapur</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1645, Shivaji acquired control of several strategic from under the Bijapur Sultanate around Pune – Torna from
        Inayat Khan, Chakan from FirangojiNarsala, Kondana from Adil Shahi Governor, along with Singhagarh and Purandar.
        Following his success, he had emerged as a threat for Mohammed Adil Shah who gave the order to imprison Shahaji
        in 1648. Shahaji was released on condition that Shivaji kept a low profile and kept from further conquests.
        Shivaji resumed his conquests after Shahaji’s death in 1665 by acquiring the valley of Javali from Chandrarao
        More, a Bijapuri jaigirdaar. Mohammed Adil Shah sent Afzal Khan, a powerful general in his employ to subdue
        Shivaji.</p>
